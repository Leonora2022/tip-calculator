#TIP CALCULATOR
Figuring out how much to tip can be tricky — especially if you’re aiming to calculate an exact percentage or want to split the tip among a group. Our tip calculator can help take the guesswork out of tipping by doing the math for you.

Keep in mind that the results you’ll get from the tip calculator are only an estimate based on the information you provide. Additionally, the results assume that you’ll be paying the entire tip yourself or splitting it equally among a certain number of people.
